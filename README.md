# AI-Powered-Automated-Plant-Health-Diagnosis-system 
1. Introduction
Agriculture plays a vital role in global food security and economic development. However, plant diseases significantly reduce crop yields and farmer incomes. Traditionally, disease identification relies on manual inspection by experts, which is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to human error.

To address these challenges, AI-powered automated plant health diagnosis systems have emerged as effective solutions. By using computer vision and deep learning, these systems can automatically detect diseases from images of plant leaves, improving speed, accuracy, and accessibility for farmers and researchers alike.

3. Objectives
Automate the identification of plant diseases using AI.
Enable farmers to detect plant health issues using mobile/web interfaces.
Improve agricultural productivity and reduce reliance on expert intervention.
